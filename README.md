Data has become the center of today's businesses. In this modern world, 1.7 megaBytes data is generated per second. Many technologies have evolved to use this massive data for a better world. Machine learning is one of them and today we plan to use it to detect fake news.

Data Description: The Data consists of 20,000 plus rows of fake and real articles. The goal is to develop a machine-learning algorithm to detect whether a given news article is real or fake.
